  <title>JS Reference VS Copy</title>

  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // const team2 = players.slice();
    // console.log(team2, players);
    // team2[2] = 'ngok';
    // console.log(team2, players);
 

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // const team2 = [].concat(players);
    // console.log(team2, players);
    // team2[2] = 'ngok';
    // console.log(team2, players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // const team2 = [...players];
    // console.log(team2, players);
    // team2[2] = 'ngok';
    // console.log(team2, players);

    // const team2 = Array.from(players);
    // console.log(team2, players);
    // team2[2] = 'ngok';
    // console.log(team2, players);


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const team2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99})
    console.log(team2,person)

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
